The purpose of this project was to create a bot to perform sentiment analysis on certain subreddits in an attempt to automate stock trading.

Unfortunately after completing the C# project side, Reddit changed the way that their API is done. Making PRAW a much better route to take.
Additionally Webull no longer has an API so all plans went out the door.

Regardless the PRAW section of this project still grabs posts from specific subreddits and performs a sentiment analysis. Providing some minor insight.
